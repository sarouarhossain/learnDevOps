### Configuration file detail
Configuration file has 3 parts
1. metadata
2. specification
3. status -> this one is generated by k8s. k8s always check what is the desired state and what is the actual status. If it finds dissimilarities k8s will adjust automatically. k8s get this status data from etcd.

A demo of a configuration file is like bellow -

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels: 
    app: nginx 
# specification of the deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
# specification of the container          
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

***metadata*** is the data about the deployment information.
***spec*** is the specifications.
***template*** is like configuration file inside of a configuration file. it defines the configuration if a pod. *spec* inside the template is the bluprint of the pod.
