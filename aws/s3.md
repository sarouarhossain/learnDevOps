* S3 -> Simple storage service. Secure durable highly scalable storage object. 
* files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB
* unlimited storage
* bucket is basically a folder
* S3 is a universal namespace. Names must be unique globally
* Key -> name of the object 
* Value -> data of the object 
* Version ID -> important for versioning 
* Metadata -> data about data

### Special 
-> Access control list
-> Torrent 

### Consistency
* Read after write (PUTS)
* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)

### S3 features
* Tiered Storage Available
* Lifecycle Management 
* Versioning 
* Encryption
* MFA Delete
* Secure data using Access Control List and Bucket policies

### S3 standard 
99.99% availability, 99.99999999999% durability. Stored redundently across multiple device and multiple facilities. Designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

### S3 infrequently access(IA)
Accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access. Lower fee then s3, but charged retrival fee. 

### S3 one zone IA 
low cost

### S3 Intelligent Tiering 
Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.

### S3 Glacier
Glacier is for data archiving. Reliably store any amount of data. Low cost, Retrival time configurable from minutes to hours. 

### S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Lowest cost storage. Retrival time 12 hours is acceptable.

### S3 charges
* Storage
* Requests
* Storage management pricing (different tiering)
* Data transfer 
* Transfer acceleration
* Cross region replication

### Exam tips
* bucket name share common name space
* When you view your buackets ypu view them globally but you can have bucket in individual regions
* replicate the contants of buckets in different region
* can change storage classes and encryption of your object on the fly

### Restricting Bucket Access
* Bucket Policies -> Applies accross the whole bucket
* Object policies(Access control list) -> Applies to individual files
* IAM Policies to Users & Groups -> Applies to users and groups 

### Security and Encryption
* Encryption in transit is achieved by SSL/TLS
* SSE(Server side encryption) S3 managed keys -> Keys is the way of encrypting and decryption object
* AWS Key management service, managed keys - SSE-KMS
* Server side encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C
* Also you can do Client side encryption
